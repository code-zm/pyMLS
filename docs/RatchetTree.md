### Overview
The `RatchetTree` class is a core component of the Message Layer Security (MLS) protocol, implementing a binary tree structure to manage cryptographic keys for secure group communication. It ensures efficient, secure key updates and synchronization among group members.

### Key Features
- Binary Tree Structure: Supports operations on leaves and internal nodes, such as adding, removing, or updating members.
- Parent Hash Validation: Ensures integrity by validating parent hashes.
- Synchronization: Updates the tree state based on public key information.
- Serialization: Enables storing and transferring the tree's state.

### Class Details

#### Node
Represents a node in the ratchet tree.
- Attributes:
    - `publicKey` (Optional[bytes]): The public key for the node.
    - `privateKey` (Optional[X25519PrivateKey]): The private key for the node.
    - `parentHash` (Optional[bytes]): The computed hash of the node's parent.

#### RatchetTree
Implements the ratchet tree.
- Initialization:
```python
# Initializes a tree with the specified number of leaves.
RatchetTree(numLeaves: int, initialSecret: bytes, hashManager: TranscriptHashManager, groupContext: Optional[dict] = None)
```
- Methods:
    - `initializeLeaves`: Initializes all leaf nodes with key pairs.
    - `computeParentHashes`: Computes hashes for all parent nodes.
    - `validateParentHashes`: Validates the integrity of parent hashes.
    - `syncTree(publicTree: List[Optional[bytes]])`: Synchronizes the tree with a given public state.
    - `addMember(keyPackage: KeyPackage)`: Adds a new member to the tree.
    - `removeMember(memberIndex: int)`: Removes a member from the tree.
    - `updateMemberKey(memberIndex: int, newPublicKey: bytes)`: Updates a member's key.
    - `serializeTree`: Serializes the tree's state into bytes.
    - `deserializeTree`: Deserializes the tree's state from bytes.
    - `getPublicState`: Retrieves the tree's public state.
