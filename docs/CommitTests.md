### Documentation for `test_commit.py`
The `test_commit.py` test suite validates the behavior and functionality of the `Commit` class, ensuring compliance with the MLS protocol.

#### Test Cases:
1. `test_commit_serialization`: Tests serialization of a Commit object.
    - Expected Outcome:
        - The serialized output is a byte string.

2. `test_commit_deserialization`: Tests deserialization of a serialized Commit object.
    - Expected Outcome:
        - The deserialized Commit matches the original Commit's attributes.

3. `test_commit_signing`: Tests the signing of a Commit message using a private key.
    - Expected Outcome:
        - The `signature` attribute of the Commit is populated.

4. `test_commit_signature_verification`: Tests verification of a Commit's signature using the corresponding public key.
    - Expected Outcome:
        - The signature is valid, and the test returns `True`.

5. `test_commit_signature_verification_failure`: Tests failure scenarios for signature verification (e.g., tampered Commit).
    - Expected Outcome:
        - The signature verification fails, and the test returns `False`.

6. `test_commit_application`: Tests the application of a Commit to the group state, including processing proposals.
    - Expected Outcome:
        - Proposals are correctly applied to the RatchetTree.
        - Epoch secrets and transcript hash are updated.

#### Utilities:
- `MockRatchetTree`: A mock implementation of the `RatchetTree` class used for testing. Includes methods for adding, removing, and updating members.

- `setUp` Method: Initializes shared test resources, including:
    - An Ed25519 key pair.
    - A `Commit` object with mock proposals.
    - A `MockRatchetTree` and necessary cryptographic secrets.

#### Usage:
Run the test suite using the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_commit.py
```
